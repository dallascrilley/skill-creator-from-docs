# Minimal Skeleton Template

**Purpose**: Simplified template for straightforward skills that don't need complex structure.

**When to use this template:**
- Simple skills with clear, linear workflows
- Skills that don't require scripts, references, or assets
- Skills where Quick Start section is sufficient
- First-time skill builders who want less to delete

**What's included:**
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, license)
- Quick Start section
- Critical Rules (Always Do / Never Do)
- Common Patterns
- Official Documentation links

**What's NOT included:**
- Optional sections (Known Issues, Configuration Files, Advanced Topics, etc.)
- Example scripts/references/assets directories
- Setup checklists or troubleshooting sections

**Customization:**
1. Replace all [TODO:] markers with actual content
2. Add sections as needed (e.g., Dependencies, Troubleshooting)
3. If you need scripts/references/assets, create those directories manually
4. Verify against [ONE_PAGE_CHECKLIST.md](../../ONE_PAGE_CHECKLIST.md)

**If you need more structure**, use the `skill-skeleton` template instead, which includes all optional sections.
